make some decisions."},{"from":4228.52,"to":4232.74,"location":2,"content":"Um, so we might decide that these two clusters"},{"from":4232.74,"to":4237.38,"location":2,"content":"are coreferent and

that,"},{"from":4448.68,"to":4455.25,"location":2,"content":"um, there are many metrics that people have used to evaluate coreference,"},{"from":4455.25,"to":4457.68,"location":2,"content":"and they
